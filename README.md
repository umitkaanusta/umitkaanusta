## Work with a freelancer whose first priority is to deliver solid results

You have some data (or you don't). You want to see how you can utilize data as a competitive advantage for your company.

I deliver data-informed solutions for different use cases. Here's what distinguishes me:

- I've built complete solutions starting from business analysis and ETL to modelling and reporting, all of which yielded great results
  - Analogy for non-tech people: Deciding what to cook for someone, growing/buying its ingredients, cooking, and serving in the appropriate setting
- I can understand your business problems and concerns
- I can communicate the solution with different stakeholders: executives, designers, developers, marketers, salespeople, etc.
- I am good with ambiguity
- I keep up with the academic literature, this helps me come up with out-of-the-box approaches and original solutions

Tech stack: Python (including data analysis and ML libraries), Java, Django/Flask/FastAPI, AWS, Postgres, MongoDB, Neo4j
