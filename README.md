:moneybag: [**Trying a New Fraud Detection Approach for Trust Networks**](https://github.com/umitkaanusta/FraudRingDetection-TrustNetworks-Trying-New-Approach) While trying to detect fraud rings in the bitcoin-otc network, I **came up with an individual fraud detection approach which is better than 9 of 10 well-known network-based fraud detection algorithms for this problem**. (At least for this data set, I'll try it in different datasets and tune the models when I have time for that)
